# :christmas_tree: :snake: :sparkles: Maja's Advent of Code 2024 :sparkles: :snake: :christmas_tree:

Ho, ho, ho, welcome to my 2024 Advent of Code repository!
My goal this year:
- solve the first 10 puzzles within 24h of their release (FAILED)
- practice my new-learned Kotlin skills and functional programming


## Solutions overview


Puzzle | Solution(s)            | Remarks |
---    |------------------------|----
[Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) | [Kotlin](src/Day01.kt) | Easy warm-up puzzle for day one!
[Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2) | [Kotlin](src/Day02.kt) | I learned about `zipWithNext()`. I still want to learn a better way to solve pt2.
[Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3) | [Kotlin](src/Day03.kt) | Instead of iterating through the string and switching states, I decided to regex it. I'd like to explore the possibility of capturing everything with a single regex pass.
[Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4) | [Kotlin](src/Day04.kt) |
[Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/5) | [Kotlin](src/Day05.kt) |
[Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6) | [Kotlin](src/Day06.kt) |
[Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8) | [Kotlin](src/Day08.kt) |
[Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/10) | [Kotlin](src/Day10.kt) |
[Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/11) | [Kotlin](src/Day11.kt) | One mutable map is faster than multiple map instances...
[Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/13) | [Kotlin](src/Day13.kt) | Solving a 2x2 system of equations
