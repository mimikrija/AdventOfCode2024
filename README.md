# :christmas_tree: :snake: :sparkles: Maja's Advent of Code 2024 :sparkles: :snake: :christmas_tree:

Ho, ho, ho, welcome to my 2024 Advent of Code repository!
My goal this year:
- solve the first 10 puzzles within 24h of their release
- practice my new-learned Kotlin skills and functional programming


## Solutions overview


Puzzle | Solution(s)            | Remarks |
---    |------------------------|----
[Day 1: Historian Hysteria](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) | [Kotlin](src/Day01.kt) | Easy warm-up puzzle for day one!
[Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2) | [Kotlin](src/Day02.kt) | I learned about `zipWithNext()`. I still want to learn a better way to solve pt2.
[Day 3: Mull It Over](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3) | [Kotlin](src/Day03.kt) | Instead of iterating through the string and switching states, I decided to regex it. I'd like to explore the possibility of capturing everything with a single regex pass.
